How the Resilience Score Works

Each factor is normalized to 0–1.
The formula:

Resilience Score =
   (Income Weight × Income_Norm)
 + (Unemployment Weight × (1 – Unemployment_Norm))
 + (Cost Weight × (1 – Cost_Norm))


Meaning:

Higher income → more resilience

Higher unemployment → less resilience

Higher cost of living → less resilience
